# Galaxy Coding Conventions

## Release Versioning

Galaxy uses [Semantic Versioning][1] conventions. In short, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, when we increment the:

* MAJOR version, we made incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version, we added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version, we made backwards-compatible bug fixes.

We might add additional labels for pre-release and build metadata as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
