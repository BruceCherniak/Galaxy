This directory is preliminary work on streamline tracing.   

The vectors.vti includes to variables: oneBall and 'vectors', which define a helical vector field.

The vti2json script creates .json format descriptors and .raw files.   Use it like vti2vol.

The tester.state file simply defines a Datasets that includes the vector volume.

The tester.cpp program uses the RungeKutta.cpp,h to trace streamlines through the vector field.
Run it:

  mpirun -np k tester -n N 

It will trace 10 streamlines seeded along a diagonal at Z=-0.9

That'll start up k processes and generate streamlines up to N points long.

The traces are converted to path lines by the capability in TraceToPathLines.*

The results are then rendered using hardcoded settings.
